## How to Play

1. When you start the game, the board will be displayed, and you will be prompted to enter the names of the two players.

2. You will also be asked to choose whether you want to play as X or O. The other player will automatically be assigned the remaining symbol.

3. The game will randomly decide which player goes first.

4. Players will take turns to make their moves by entering a position on the board (1-9) where they want to place their symbol.

5. After each move, the updated board will be displayed.

6. The game continues until one of the players wins by getting three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or until the board is full, resulting in a draw.

7. If the game ends, you will have the option to play again.
