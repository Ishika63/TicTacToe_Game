# TicTacToe Game

This project provides a fun and interactive way to play the classic game of TicTacToe with some added features.

## Types of TicTacToe

We offer two distinct versions of TicTacToe to cater to different preferences and skill levels:

1. **Basic TicTacToe**
2. **Advanced TicTacToe**

For detailed rules and gameplay instructions for each version, please refer to the respective folders in this repository.

## Single Player Mode with Artificial Intelligence

We understand that sometimes it's not easy to find an opponent, so we've added an Artificial Intelligence component to the game, allowing you to enjoy a single-player mode with a challenging computer opponent. Test your skills against our AI and see if you can emerge victorious!

### Specifications

- **Player Count**: Both versions of the game allow two players to play together, sitting at the same computer. It's a great way to engage in friendly battles and competitions.
